# This file makes the 'backend' directory a Python package.
# It can be left empty, or used for package-level initialization.

# For now, we'll just define some package-level variables or perform setup if needed later.
# For example, you might put global configurations or service initializations here.

# Example: Define a logger for the backend package (optional)
# import logging
# logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# logger.info("Backend package initialized.")
